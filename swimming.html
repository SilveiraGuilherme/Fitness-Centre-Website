                  	<h3>Why choose swimming?</h3>
						<p>Swimming is a complete sport for both body and mind. Practicing this sport offers several benefits and, 
						as it is a low-impact sport, it is recommended for everyone who wants to practice physical activity.</p>
						<p>When swimming, we exercise our body's muscles all at the same time, which helps with strengthening, 
						improves respiratory condition and helps burn calories. Another positive point of this physical activity is that
						it can be practiced from a baby to older ages.</p>
                    	<p>If you haven't tried this pleasurable sport yet, perhaps now is the ideal time to go all out in this aquatic world.</p>
